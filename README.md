# Python-ImageSearch

it's a wrapper around pyautogui and opencv2, to allow you to easily add cross-platform image searching capabilities
to your project.

See the documentation for examples. If you have any questions feel free to contact me.

You may need to install dependencies depending on your OS:

```
### Windows :

No setup should be needed 

### MacOs :

pip3 install -U pyobjc-core
pip3 install -U pyobjc

I have not tested myself as I don't own a mac, but it was tested and documented in this issue : https://github.com/drov0/python-imagesearch/issues/5
